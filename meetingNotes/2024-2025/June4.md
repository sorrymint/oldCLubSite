### 2025-2026 Club Schedule

We need to start planning the 2025-2026 Club Schedule.
We want to meet the first, second, and third Wednesday on each month.
We also need to pick dates for club events (fall picnic and game nights).
We also need ideas for other club events (low budget).
Club Leadership will get together to build this schedule.
The finalized schedule will be sent to marketing.

###  Personal Project Planning

I want you all to make a person project. It has to be something built outside of class that you would be proud of and put on your resume.
Over the summer I want you all to plan this project.
We have 6 club meeting. 
I have come up with a 6-step plan we will be going though.
We are going to cover this during the club meeting, but you **MUST** work on this outside of these meeting to keep up. 
This is to get them excited and motivated to build your personal project later. Here is my ideas so
far please add to it and make it take up the six club meetings.

1. Idea (What personal problem does it solve? )
2. Feature list and Rough wireframe
3. High Resolution wireframe / Integrative demo
4. Pick Tech Stack
5. UML for Database
6. Project Roadmap, Environment Setup, and Discovery 

#### Personal Project Planning Step 1

The Idea.
This is the hardest part. 
Think of your every day live. What small things frustrate your or slow you down? 
Come up with a simple tech solution. 
Share Example (lockdown safe breaker): https://lockdown-case-puzzle.vercel.app
Keep this idea in scope. 
This idea does not need to be market viable or a smashing success. 
Interviewers will find a polished project, cool tech stack and an interesting story more interesting and impressive then an over scoped project that doesn't work. 
Please come up with something original. 
Knockoffs or sample projects (Hello World or a TODO List) are just not interesting.

Ask yourself the following questions (I answered them from the lockdown example): 

- What problem does your project solve?     
  - My Friends can't beat this mini-game. 
- How are you going to solve the problem with your app? 
  - Allow the user to practice the mini-game in a recreation of the game. 
- What is the scope of your project?
  - Just a small mini-game. No login, monetization or DB leaderboard. Those could be stretch goals. 
- What is your target platform?
  - Web
- Who is your userbase (it's ok if its just you).
  - Me and my friends
